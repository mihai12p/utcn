 * @brief       Handles the "register" command.
 *
 *
 * @details     This command is available only if no user is currently logged in.
 *              If a user is logged in, this command will return an error status.
 *
 *              If there is already a user with the name from the "Username" string,
 *              the command will return an error status.
 *
 *              If the user is successfully registered, a subdirectory
 *              %APPDIR%\\Users\\<Username> will be created. A unique identifier (e.g. a pair (username, password)) will be
 *              saved in a separate file %APPDIR%\\users.txt.
 *              The password will not be saved in plain text (see the @note section below).
 *              If the "Users" subdirectory does not exist in %APPDIR%, it must be created before creating the <Username> directory.

 *
 * @param[in]   Username        - A string representing the username.
 *
 * @param[in]   UsernameLength  - The length of the "Username" string,
 *                                not including the NULL terminator.
 *
 * @param[in]   Password        - A string representing the user's password.
 *
 * @param[in]   PasswordLength  - The length of the "Password" string,

 *
 *
 * @note        Some limits are imposed on the strings:
 *                      - Username string: must contain only English alphabet letters (a-zA-Z);
 *                                         must contain a minimum of 5 characters and a maximum of 10;
 *                      - Password string: must be at least 5 characters long;
 *                                         must contain at least one digit;
 *                                         must contain at least one lowercase letter and one uppercase letter;
 *                                         must contain at least one special symbol (!@#$%^&);
 *              The password will not be saved in plain text (how you store the password is up to you):
 *                      - suggestions: MD5, SHA256
 *                      - see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/example-c-program--creating-an-md-5-hash-from-file-content
